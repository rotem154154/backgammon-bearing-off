# backgammon-bearing-off
This project allows you get statistics about bearing off board (when all checkers in home board)
* show the best move for given board and dice
* show the average amount of moves until win
* show the precent to win against another player

#### What I implemented for this project:
* Dynamic algorithm to calculate the best move for any board
* Simulate random games from given board to get average amount of moves to win
* Create dataset of random boards competing with each others to see the precent of each player to win under random dice.
* create regression neural network to show the win percentage for any two given boards
